# -Flink-Food-Delivery-App-Figma-UI-UX-Project
The Flink Food Delivery App is a modern UI/UX concept design I created in Figma (June 2024), aiming to deliver a seamless and engaging food ordering experience. The design balances simplicity, vibrant visuals, and user-friendly navigation, reflecting the fast-paced and convenience-driven nature of food delivery services.
